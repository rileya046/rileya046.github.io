### CPSC 120
* Lab 4
Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite of mine, as it was fun to work out how to code a game, even if it was simplistic in nature. It was one of the first times I got to work with game mechanics, which has always been a fascinating topic for me. I enjoyed coding the parameters and return statements especially, because that is what you saw when you played the game.

* Lab 8
Lab 8 part 1 was a difficult but rewarding experience, as it involved working with vectors to produce an output. I have always loved the MadLibs games on road trips, and it was an enjoyable challenge to code it in C++. It was difficult, especially in the beginning, but the tasked helped me better understand how to operate vectors.

* Lab 11
Lab 11 was one of the first times I got to properly get the code to have no errors, including linter and formatting issues, which was a huge accomplishment for me. I liked the complexity in both parts of the assignment. It was also fun to revisit another side to the challenge originally from Lab 4.
