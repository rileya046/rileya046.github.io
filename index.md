# Hello World
This is my home page! My name is Lexie Riley and I am a student at [Cal State Fullerton](http://www.fullerton.edu/) and my major is Computer Science.

### CPSC 120
* Lab 4
Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite of mine, as it was fun to work out how to code a game, even if it was simplistic in nature. I had to write code that used variables, initialization, arithmetic operators, input, output, if statements, and relational operators to create a working product. It was one of the first times I got to work with game mechanics, which has always been a fascinating topic for me.

* Lab 8
Lab 8 part 1 was a difficult but rewarding experience, as it involved working with vectors to produce an output. I have always loved the MadLibs games on road trips, and it was an enjoyable challenge to code it in C++. I used loops to iterate through all command-line arguments, skipping over the command name, which helped navigate the vectors. It was difficult, especially in the beginning, but the tasked helped me better understand how to operate vectors.

* Lab 11
Lab 11 was one of the first times I got to properly get the code to have no errors, including linter and formatting issues, which was a huge accomplishment for me. I liked the complexity in both parts of the assignment. I wrote member function definitions for object-oriented classes as a part of the assignment, and worked hard with my partner to understand the functions behind the random number generation. It was also fun to revisit another side to the challenge originally from Lab 4.
